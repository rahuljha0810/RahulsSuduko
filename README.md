# RahulsSuduko
This is Java project in which i am using java Swing to build a game that allows the user to solve Sudoku puzzles.
The aim of the project is to recreate the experience of solving Sudoku puzzles that people used to do in newspapers.
The game consists of a 9x9 grid of boxes that can be filled with digits from 1 to 9.
The game has a reset button, an exit button, and a check moves button.
The reset button empties the whole grid, the exit button closes the execution, the solution button fills the grid with expected solutions, and the check moves button checks whether the move is correct or not.
The game grid consists of 9 rows and 9 columns, which are buttons that can be clicked to fill the digit in the box.
The game will be built from scratch, and it will be a combination of a 9x9 matrix of buttons.
# Technology
The project will primarily use Java language for coding.
Java Swing will also be used to build the GUI application.
Java Swing is a part of JFC (Java Foundation Classes) which is used to create window-based applications.
AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) is the base for Java Swing.
Java Swing is used to build lightweight GUI applications.
Java Swing provides a lot of styling components such as buttons, labels, text fields, etc. for building the GUI.
JFrames are top-level containers provided by Java Swing which provide a playground for designing components.
JFrames are also known as base windows on which other components such as menu bars, panels, labels, text fields, buttons, etc. rely.
Almost every Java Swing application starts with the JFrame window.
